### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Imdadul
#### I am a Web developer


I'm currently focused on web development projects, with plans to create a blog site using React.js, Django, and PostgreSQL. Another project of mine involves developing a trading app with a similar tech stack. I'm exploring ways to embed PDF files into blog posts in a Django-based project.

I'm also interested in learning Python for both web development and algorithmic trading. Additionally, I'm working on a Django project that doesn't yet have a user authentication system integrated.

Skills: Python / REACT / JS / HTML / CSS / Django / POSTGRESQL
